Multinational retail company dealing in sports goods. Analyzing payment behavior to predict late payments

**Project Objective**:
Schuster's business objective is to analyze past payment patterns to understand customer behavior and predict the likelihood of delayed payments for open invoices. This predictive capability allows collectors to prioritize follow-up efforts and ensure timely payments.

**Problem Statement**:
1. Certain customers consistently delay payments, leading to significant financial losses for both parties. Despite imposing heavy late payment fees, this practice undermines long-term business relationships.
2. To mitigate these challenges, Schuster seeks to analyze vendor payment patterns and forecast the probability of late payments for outstanding invoices. This proactive approach aims to reduce non-value-added activities, save time, and minimize financial repercussions.

**Dataset Description**:

We are given 2 datasets : 
1. 'Received_Payment_Data.csv'   
Contains the information of all the transactions that have been performed with various vendors in the past.
2. ‘Open_Invoice_Data.csv’
This data contains the information of all the invoices that are open, i.e. that haven't been paid yet.
